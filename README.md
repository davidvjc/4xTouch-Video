# 4xTouch-Video
Control scenes from afar using node.js and socket.io

The server uses socket.io Run it and open the client on your phone and the host on your laptop (or screen or projector). Now you can manipulate the host video from your mobile touch device. Works well with most browsers. I've tried it on Safari on an iPhone 6.

Requires Hammer.js but you could probably use it for other things too.
